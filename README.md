# TensorFlow-Lite-Object-Detection-on-Android-and-Raspberry-Pi
A tutorial showing how to train, convert, and run TensorFlow Lite object detection models on Android devices, the Raspberry Pi, and more!


## Currently Under Construction

This guide is currently under construction! Here are expected dates for when major portions will be completed:

| Part | Expected Completion Date |
|------|--------------------------|
|Part 1 - How to Train, Convert, and Run Custom TensorFlow Lite Object Detection Models|September 22, 2019 |
|Part 2 - How to Run TensorFlow Lite Object Detection Models on the Raspberry Pi|September 29, 2019 |
|Part 3 - How to Run TensorFlow Lite Object Detection Models on Android Devices|October 6, 2019 |

I will also be creating a series of YouTube videos that walk through each step of the guide.
