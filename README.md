# TensorFlow-Lite-Object-Detection-on-Android-and-Raspberry-Pi
A tutorial showing how to train, convert, and run TensorFlow Lite object detection models on Android devices, the Raspberry Pi, and more!


## Currently Under Construction

This guide is currently under construction! Here are expected dates for when major portions will be completed:

| Part | Description | Expected Completion Date |
|------|-------------|--------------------------|
|Part 1| How to Train, Convert, and Run Custom TensorFlow Lite Object Detection Models|September 22, 2019 |
|Part 2| How to Run TensorFlow Lite Object Detection Models on the Raspberry Pi with [Coral USB Accelerator](https://coral.withgoogle.com/products/accelerator/)|September 29, 2019 |
|Part 3| How to Run TensorFlow Lite Object Detection Models on Android Devices|October 6, 2019 |

I will also be creating a series of YouTube videos that walk through each step of the guide.


## Introduction
TensorFlow Lite is an optimized framework for deploying lightweight deep learning models on resource-constrained edge devices. TensorFlow Lite models have faster inference time and require less processing power, so they can be used to obtain faster performance in realtime applications. This guide provides step-by-step instructions for how train a custom TensorFlow Object Detection model, convert it into an optimized format that can be used by TensorFlow Lite, and run it on Android phones or the Raspberry Pi.

The guide is broken into three major portions. Each portion will have its own dedicated README file in this repository.
1. How to Train, Convert, and Run Custom TensorFlow Lite Object Detection Models
2. How to Run TensorFlow Lite Object Detection Models on the Raspberry Pi (with optional Coral USB Accelerator)
3. How to Run TensorFlow Lite Object Detection Models on Android Devices

This repository also contains Python code for running the newly converted TensorFlow Lite model to perform detection on images, videos, or webcam feeds.
